Cyber Physical Systems models are representations of systems that integrate computational elements and physical processes.
## Mathematical Model:
- Physical Models:Describe the behavior of the physical componnents in terms of mathematical equations.
- Cyber Models: Represent the computational elements of the system using formalisms like finite state machines, petri nets, or other mathematical model that capture the behavior of software and communication protocols
## Co-Simulation:
- CPS often involves the itneraction of multiple domains, such as mechanical, electrical, and software.
## Functional Models:
- Define the functions and behaviors of the overall system.
- This includes the logical interactions between the cyber and physical components to achieve specific objectives.
## Others
- Real Time Contranints
- Siulation and Analysis
- Verification and Validation
- Formal Methods
- Modeling Languages
